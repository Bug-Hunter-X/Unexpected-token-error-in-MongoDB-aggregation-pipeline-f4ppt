# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The error message is often unhelpful, leading to confusion in debugging.

The bug is related to a syntax error or logic error in the aggregation pipeline query, specifically within the `$group` stage, causing an "Unexpected token" error.  The solution shows how to correct the aggregation pipeline to achieve the desired results.
